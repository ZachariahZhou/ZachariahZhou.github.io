Data is being regarded as a kind of valuable 
assets with the fast development of the data-driven Artificial 
Intelligence technologies. In this paper, we introduce the 
concept of data watermarking to protect the power system data 
assets to secure the data authenticity and prevent from being 
misused. A deep-learning based watermarking model with 
specially designed loss functions and network structure is 
proposed to embed watermarks into the original dataset. A 
comprehensive evaluation framework is designed to evaluate 
the watermarking performance in the aspects of invisibility, 
restorability, robustness, secrecy and false-positive detection. 
Case study based on real-world load time series dataset 
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method
